\title{Highlights from ``The OpenMC Monte Carlo Particle Transport Code''}
\author{Paul K. Romano, Benoit Forget}
\maketitle

\begin{itemize}
\item An open source Monte Carlo particle transport code, OpenMC, has been developed.
\item Solid geometry and continuous-energy physics allow high-fidelity simulations.
\item Development has focused on high performance and modern I/O techniques.
\item OpenMC is capable of scaling up to hundreds of thousands of processors.
\item Results on a variety of benchmark problems agree with MCNP5.
\end{itemize}
