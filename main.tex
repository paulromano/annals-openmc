\section{Introduction}

The introduction of exascale computing in the next decade will introduce a
variety of challenges both for hardware and software developers. As such,
research and development efforts are underway aimed at enabling high-fidelity,
large-scale simulations that will scale on current and future computer
achitectures. To support these studies, a new Monte Carlo code has been under
development since early 2011 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The
goal in developing a new Monte Carlo code rather than using a previously
developed code is to have a code that is easily extensible for research purposes
in addition to being high performance, freely available, and written in a modern
programming language.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Physics}

The initial work on OpenMC has focused on criticality calculations as applied to
the simluation of nuclear reactors. The solution of the eigenvalue problem
proceeds by the method of successive generations [REF] wherein a constant number
of neutron histories are tracked from birth to death. The data governing the
interaction of neutrons with various nuclei are represented using the ACE format
[REF] which is used by MCNP \cite{mcnp} and Serpent \cite{serpent}. ACE-format
data can be generated with the NJOY nuclear data processing system which
converts raw ENDF/B data into linearly-interpolable data as required by most
Monte Carlo codes. The use of a standard cross section format allows for a
direct comparison of OpenMC with other codes since the same cross section
libraries can be used.

The ACE-format contains continuous-energy cross sections for the following types
of reactions: elastic scattering, fission (or first-chance fission,
second-chance fission, etc.), inelastic scattering, (n,xn), (n,$\gamma$), and
various other absorption reactions. For those reactions with one or multiple
neutrons. For those reactions with one or more neutrons in the exit channel,
secondary angle and energy distributions may be present. In addition,
fissionable nuclides have total, prompt, and/or delayed $\nu$ as a function of
energy, neutron precursor distributions. Many nuclides also have probability
tables to be used for accurate treatment of self-shielding in the unresolved
resonance range. For bound scatterers, separate tables with $S(\alpha,\beta)$
scattering law data can be used. Cross sections are represented as tabulated
functions of energy that are linearly interpolated between sucessive values.

For neutrons at higher energies, it can be safely assumed that the motion of the
target nucleus is negligible relative to the velocity of the neutron
itself. However, in the thermal and intermediate energy ranges, the target
velocity will alter both the cross sections and the secondary energy and angle
distributions of scattered neutrons. To account for the effect on cross
sections, Doppler broadening is typically performed in the cross section
generation stage. For the angle and energy distributions, OpenMC uses a free gas
approximation \cite{freegas} wherein the velocity of the target nuclei have a
Maxwellian distribution. For thermal neutrons scattering from bound molecules
such as hydrogen or deuterium in water, graphite, beryllium, etc., the free gas
approximation will not accurately capture the scattering kinematics and
$S(\alpha,\beta)$ scattering law data must be used.
